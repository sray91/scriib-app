### Managing Your Approvers

You can manage your approvers from the **Settings > Approvers** page:

- **Revoke Access**: Click the "Revoke" button next to an approver to remove their ability to approve your content

The post will be marked as "Pending Approval" and your approver will be notified.

### Handling Feedback

If changes are requested:

1. You'll receive a notification

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Invitation Link Expired**

   - Check that you've accepted the invitation
   - Content creators may need to resubmit content for your approval

3. **Email Notifications Not Arriving**
   - Check your spam/junk folder
   - Verify your email address is correct in your profile
   - Ensure notifications are enabled in Settings > Notifications

4. **Unable to Approve Content**
   - Make sure you're logged in
   - Check that you still have approval rights (they may have been revoked)
   - Try refreshing the page or logging out and back in
