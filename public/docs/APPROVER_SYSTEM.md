If changes are requested:

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

   - Content creators may need to resubmit content for your approval

3. **Email Notifications Not Arriving**
   - Check your spam/junk folder
   - Verify your email address is correct in your profile
   - Ensure notifications are enabled in Settings > Notifications

4. **Unable to Approve Content**
   - Make sure you're logged in
   - Check that you still have approval rights (they may have been revoked)
   - Try refreshing the page or logging out and back in
