  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  file_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  file_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (file_type IN ('pdf', 'doc', 'docx', 'txt', 'md')),
  file_size INTEGER NOT NULL,
  file_url TEXT NOT NULL, -- Supabase storage URL
  description TEXT,
  extracted_text TEXT, -- Extracted content from document
  word_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  processing_status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (processing_status IN ('pending', 'processing', 'completed', 'failed')),
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  metadata JSONB, -- Additional file metadata
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);
```
