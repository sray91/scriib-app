# LinkedIn Best Practices

## Post Structure

### Hook (First 2-3 lines)
The hook appears before "...see more" - it must compel readers to click.

**Effective hook patterns:**
- **Contrarian**: Challenge a common belief ("Unpopular opinion: meetings aren't the problem")
- **Curiosity gap**: Create intrigue ("The best advice I got was also the hardest to hear")
- **Bold statement**: Make a strong claim ("Your morning routine is sabotaging your productivity")
- **Question**: Engage directly ("What's the worst career advice you've ever received?")
- **Story opener**: Begin mid-action ("I was about to quit when my phone rang")
- **Result teaser**: Lead with outcome ("This one change doubled our team's output")

**Hook rules:**
- Keep under 200 characters
- No hashtags in the hook
- Create tension or curiosity
- Be specific, not generic

### Body
- Use line breaks liberally (LinkedIn rewards white space)
- One idea per paragraph
- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences max)
- Lists work well (numbered or bulleted)
- Include a "value moment" - the insight readers will remember

### Ending
- Match the user's CTA style (soft, direct, or none)
- Soft CTA: "What do you think?" or "I'd love to hear your take"
- Direct CTA: "Follow for more" or "Share if this resonated"
- No CTA: End on the insight, let it land

## Length Guidelines

- **Short posts** (500-800 chars): Single insight, punchy delivery
- **Medium posts** (800-1500 chars): Story + lesson, or framework
- **Long posts** (1500-2500 chars): Detailed story, multiple insights, lists
- **Avoid**: Under 300 chars (too thin) or over 3000 chars (loses readers)

## Formatting Tips

- **Line breaks**: Use double line breaks between paragraphs
- **Emphasis**: Occasional ALL CAPS for one word is OK, not sentences
- **Lists**: Number for sequences, bullets for equal items
- **Emojis**: Only if user's voice profile includes them
- **Hashtags**: Only if user's voice profile includes them, max 3-5, at the end

## What Performs Well

1. **Personal vulnerability** (when authentic)
2. **Contrarian takes** (backed by reasoning)
3. **Specific numbers/results**
4. **Relatable struggles**
5. **Actionable frameworks**
6. **Questions that provoke thought**

## What to Avoid

1. **Humble brags** ("So humbled to announce my promotion to CEO")
2. **Generic platitudes** ("Work hard, dream big")
3. **Engagement bait** ("Like if you agree!")
4. **Corporate speak** ("Synergizing our value proposition")
5. **Walls of text** (no line breaks)
6. **Too many hashtags** (looks spammy)
7. **Negativity without insight** (complaining vs. teaching)

## The LinkedIn Algorithm

Posts perform better when they:
- Get engagement in the first hour
- Have meaningful comments (not just "Great post!")
- Keep readers on the platform (no external links in the post body)
- Generate "dwell time" (people stop scrolling to read)

Write posts that invite conversation, not just agreement.
