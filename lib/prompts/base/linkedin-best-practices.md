# LinkedIn Best Practices

## Post Structure

### Hook (First 2-3 lines)
The hook appears before "...see more" - it must compel readers to click.

**Effective hook patterns:**
- **Contrarian**: Challenge a common belief ("Unpopular opinion: meetings aren't the problem")
- **Curiosity gap**: Create intrigue - but only about real insights, not manufactured drama
- **Bold statement**: Make a strong claim you can actually defend
- **Question**: Engage directly ("What's the worst career advice you've ever received?")
- **Observation**: Lead with something true ("Most feedback conversations fail before they start")
- **Framework intro**: Promise actionable value ("Three questions that change every 1:1")

**NEVER use these hooks unless the user provided the actual story/data:**
- "I was [doing X] when [Y happened]..." - requires a REAL event
- "Last [time period], I..." - requires a REAL event
- "A client/mentor/friend once told me..." - requires a REAL quote
- "This one change [specific result]..." - requires REAL metrics

**Hook rules:**
- Keep under 200 characters
- No hashtags in the hook
- Create tension or curiosity
- Be specific, not generic

### Body
- Use line breaks liberally (LinkedIn rewards white space)
- One idea per paragraph
- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences max)
- Lists work well (numbered or bulleted)
- Include a "value moment" - the insight readers will remember

### Ending
- Match the user's CTA style (soft, direct, or none)
- Soft CTA: "What do you think?" or "I'd love to hear your take"
- Direct CTA: "Follow for more" or "Share if this resonated"
- No CTA: End on the insight, let it land

## Length Guidelines

- **Short posts** (500-800 chars): Single insight, punchy delivery
- **Medium posts** (800-1500 chars): Story + lesson, or framework
- **Long posts** (1500-2500 chars): Detailed story, multiple insights, lists
- **Avoid**: Under 300 chars (too thin) or over 3000 chars (loses readers)

## Formatting Tips

- **Line breaks**: Use double line breaks between paragraphs
- **Emphasis**: Occasional ALL CAPS for one word is OK, not sentences
- **Lists**: Number for sequences, bullets for equal items
- **Emojis**: Only if user's voice profile includes them
- **Hashtags**: Only if user's voice profile includes them, max 3-5, at the end

## What Performs Well

1. **Actionable frameworks** - concrete steps people can use
2. **Contrarian takes** - backed by real reasoning, not just provocation
3. **Specific numbers/results** - ONLY if the user provided them
4. **Real personal stories** - ONLY if the user provided them
5. **Questions that provoke thought** - genuine curiosity, not bait
6. **Clear insights** - one non-obvious thing the reader can take away

## What to Avoid

### LinkedIn Slop Patterns (NEVER DO THESE)
1. **Manufactured vulnerability** - fake "I struggled" stories without real details
2. **Dramatic one-liner paragraphs** - the breathless. staccato. style. that. means. nothing.
3. **Vague arena/journey metaphors** - "speaking from the arena", "the path", "the journey"
4. **Fake DM/conversation openers** - "I was scrolling when I saw..." without a real story
5. **Genericized wisdom** - "Here's what I learned" without saying what actually happened
6. **Templated epiphanies** - "And that's when it hit me" about nothing specific
7. **Pseudo-profound questions** - "When was the last time you [vague thing]?"

### Other Bad Patterns
1. **Humble brags** ("So humbled to announce my promotion to CEO")
2. **Generic platitudes** ("Work hard, dream big")
3. **Engagement bait** ("Like if you agree!")
4. **Corporate speak** ("Synergizing our value proposition")
5. **Walls of text** (no line breaks)
6. **Too many hashtags** (looks spammy)
7. **Negativity without insight** (complaining vs. teaching)

## The LinkedIn Algorithm

Posts perform better when they:
- Get engagement in the first hour
- Have meaningful comments (not just "Great post!")
- Keep readers on the platform (no external links in the post body)
- Generate "dwell time" (people stop scrolling to read)

Write posts that invite conversation, not just agreement.
