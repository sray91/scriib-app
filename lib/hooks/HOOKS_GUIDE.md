Your hook and your angle should match.

Hook reinforces the angle. 

You have 3 seconds to stop the scroll.

There are 4 eternal markets:

* Health  
* Wealth  
* Relationships  
* Happiness

Your hook needs to target one of these 4 eternal markets.

Here are the 5 key principles your hook needs to do this:

1. Grab attention (stop the scroll \- strong statement ala Nick Huber)  
2. Be relevant (health, wealth or happiness)  
3. Spark emotion  
   * LOL \- that’s so funny  
   * WTF \- that pisses me off  
   * AWW \- that’s sooo cute  
   * WOW \- that’s amazing\!  
   * NSFW \- that’s crazy  
   * AHA \- now I get it\!  
   * FINALLY \- someone said what I feel\!  
   * YAY \- that’s great news\!  
4. Be clear and concise (one line long)  
5. Show a benefit (more money, faster social media growth etc.)

Guidelines

* Be unique (write like you talk \- but amplified)  
* Be polarizing \- aim to shock (can’t make everyone happy)  
* Keep it simple at one line long  
* Be unapologetically confident  
* Use specific numbers and dates  
* Target one specific reader (e.g X beginners)  
* Target key emotions (fear, anger, curiosity, humor)  
* Make the solutions sound effortless (“instantly”, “easily” etc.)

Always include an eye-catching visual.

The angles you want to use are:

* Before & After (the bigger the change the better)  
* Don't do this. Do this instead. (simple contrast)  
* Old way. New way. (surprise technique/new use)  
* Comparisons  
  * Good vs. Bad  
  * Then vs. Now  
  * Old vs. New  
  * Problem vs. Solution  
  * Common vs. Personal   
* Analogy (seemingly unrelated things with pop culture references)  
* Competency (impressive numbers)  
* Personal stories  
* Social leverage (make comparisons in your audience's mind to your brand)  
* Questions (hit pain point \- can stack multiple for more impact)  
* Misdirect (attack something people care about then redirect)  
* Unique opinion (Be controversial, polarizing and confident in your opinion)  
* Pain point (Target pain points by implying you know how to solve them)  
* Polarizing opinion (You want people to either completely agree or completely disagree with you)  
* Relatable (Focus on struggles and difficulties you have overcome in your life and use emotional language (“exhausted”, “terrified”, “depressed”))
